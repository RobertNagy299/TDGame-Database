<h1>Complete database for a tower defense game</h1>

 <!--### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)-->

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of PHP scripts for basic database functionality, extended with some custom features. Implementation can be seen in my "Connecting an external database to a C# application" repository.
<br />


<h2>Languages Used</h2>

- <b>PHP</b> 
- <b>MySQL</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b>
- <b>000Webhost (for free storage and hosting)</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

Upload the files to a website (I used 000webhost for a free website, that came with a free MySQL database with a storage of 1 GB, and I could also upload the PHP scripts to the website's scripts section)
Make sure to check out the C# implementation in my "Connecting an external database to a C# application" repository, in order to see how the database actually communicated with the Unity game.
